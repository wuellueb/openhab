This zip file contains a version of the SenchaTouch-based UI  
It can be manually added to the openHAB runtime by simply copying the
"greent" folder to ${openhab.home}/webapps. The UI is then accessible at
http://localhost:8080/greent

See https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki/TouchUI for more details.
